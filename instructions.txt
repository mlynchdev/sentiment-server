Set up a new Node.js project:
This project will use TypeScript
Create a new directory for your project
Navigate to the directory in your terminal
Run 'npm init -y' to initialize a new Node.js project
Run 'npm install fastify natural node-kmeans' to install required dependencies
Create a new file named 'app.ts' in your project directory
In app.ts, import required modules:
Fastify
Natural
Node-kmeans
Set up the Fastify application:
Create a Fastify app instance
Set the port number
Initialize in-memory storage for feedback data
Set up TF-IDF for keyword extraction using the Natural library
Create a function to extract keywords from text using TF-IDF
Create a POST route '/feedback' to receive customer feedback:
Extract keywords from the feedback text
Store the feedback and keywords in memory
Create a GET route '/analyze' to analyze feedback:
Prepare feedback data for clustering
Use K-means algorithm to cluster the feedback
Return the clustered analysis results
Start the Fastify server and listen on the specified port
Test the application:
Use a tool like Postman or curl to send POST requests to '/feedback' with feedback data
Send a GET request to '/analyze' to retrieve the analysis results
Enhance the application as needed:
Add error handling and input validation
Implement persistent storage (e.g., database integration)
Improve NLP techniques for better keyword extraction and clustering
Create a user interface for easier interaction with the API
